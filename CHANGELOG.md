## [0.6.2] - 2025-10-21

### ‚ú® New Features

  - Enter `0` for price when adding transactions
  - Cost basis correctly calculated as $0
  - Works with CSV import/export
  - UI helper text guides users
- **Configurable Duplicate Detection for CSV Import** - Added flexible duplicate detection system with 4 modes:
  - **Strict Mode**: All fields must match (date, amount, price, fees, currency, notes)
  - **Standard Mode** (Recommended): Core fields must match (date, type, amount, price)
  - **Loose Mode**: Only date and amount must match
  - **Off**: Import all transactions, including duplicates
- Enhanced import modal UI with expandable duplicate detection settings
- Better support for manual transaction entries and varied data formats
- Added 5 comprehensive CSV test files with documentation for testing duplicate detection modes
- Added customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets (5 widgets: Chart, Transactions, Goals, Portfolio, DCA)

- Redesigned Analytics page with professional layout

### üîß Bug Fixes
- Fixed DCA analysis "What-If" scenarios crashing when zero-cost transactions (mining/gifts) are present - now correctly handles division by zero
- Fixed duplicate detection being too strict - was skipping legitimate transactions with same date/amount but different fees or notes
- Import now properly handles transactions recorded in separate rows with slight variations
- Fixed Goals page crash when accessing `is_on_track` property after importing transactions - added proper null checks for achieved/expired goals
- **Fixed average buy/sell price calculations to use volume-weighted averages** - Critical accuracy fix affecting:
  - Portfolio summary and widgets (was using simple average, now uses volume-weighted)
  - Transaction summary statistics (was using simple average, now uses volume-weighted)
  - Analytics win rate calculations (now correctly weights by transaction volume)
  - Chart tooltip for grouped transactions (now shows volume-weighted average price)
  - **Impact:** Fixes significant errors in P&L, ROI, and cost basis calculations, especially for users with varied transaction sizes
- Fixed mobile PIN login missing submit button and infinite retry loop
- Fixed currency conversion bugs in portfolio and transaction P&L calculations
- Fixed 24h portfolio change showing ‚Ç¨0.00
- Fixed goals recalculation using wrong scenario growth rates
- Fixed DCA timing score being too harsh (38% below avg now scores 8.7/10 instead of 3.8/10)
- Fixed portfolio summary widget not showing unrealized P&L
- **Transaction History page does not show all transactions (#108)** - Added pagination system with configurable items per page
- **Current price data is not recalculated to main currency in DCA Calculator (#111)** - BTC price now converts from USD to user's main currency
