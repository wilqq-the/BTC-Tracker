## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express for the backend

### CoinGecko API Integration

The application uses CoinGecko's API to fetch Bitcoin price data. By default, it uses the free tier which has rate limitations.

#### Adding Your CoinGecko API Key

1. Navigate to the Admin Panel
2. In the settings section, enter your CoinGecko API key
3. Click "Test Key" to verify it works correctly
4. Save your settings

#### How to Get a CoinGecko API Key

1. Visit [CoinGecko API Pricing](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing)
2. Sign up for the "Demo" plan (free, no credit card required)
3. Copy your API key that starts with "CG-"

#### API Key Usage Notes

- Demo API keys (starting with "CG-") are passed as URL query parameters (`x_cg_demo_api_key`)
- This increases your rate limit from approximately 10-30 calls/minute to 10,000 calls/month
- The app will automatically handle correctly formatting API requests with your key
- If no API key is provided, the application uses the standard free tier endpoint
