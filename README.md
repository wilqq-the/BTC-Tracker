## Quick Start

**With Docker (recommended):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wilqq-the/BTC-Tracker.git
cd BTC-Tracker
cp docker.env.example .env
# Edit .env and add NEXTAUTH_SECRET
docker-compose up -d
```

**Local development:**
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add NEXTAUTH_SECRET to .env
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and register the first user (becomes admin automatically).

## How multi-user works

- **First user** = automatic admin
- **Admin panel** in Settings tab (admin users only)
- **Create users** with email/password
- **Each user** sees only their own transactions and portfolio
- **No data mixing** between users

## Admin features

- Create/delete user accounts
- Activate/deactivate users
- View system stats (user count, total transactions)
- Cannot see other users' financial data (privacy protection)

## Importing transactions

1. Export CSV from your exchange (Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Strike)
2. Go to Transactions tab > Import
3. Drop the CSV file - format detected automatically
4. Review and import

Supports most major exchanges. If yours isn't supported, open an issue with example file.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (single file, easy backups)
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm test         # Run tests
npx prisma studio # Database GUI
```

## Why I built this?

Existing portfolio trackers either:
- Send your data to third parties
- Don't support multiple users
- Have terrible import systems
- Cost money for basic features
- Require xpub or zpub wallet address

This gives you complete control over your Bitcoin tracking data.
