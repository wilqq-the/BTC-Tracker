# BTC Tracker

A simple, powerful application to track your Bitcoin investments and monitor their performance over time.

## GH Pages

Our [GitHub Pages documentation site](https://wilqq-the.github.io/BTC-tracker/) provides comprehensive information about BTC Tracker:
- **üöÄ Getting Started**: Detailed installation and setup instructions
- **üì∏ Screenshots**: See the application interface and features in action
- **‚≠ê Features**: Complete overview of all BTC Tracker capabilities

## Why BTC Tracker?

I've created BTC Tracker because I needed a simpler solution for tracking Bitcoin investments. Existing applications were either too complex, designed for tracking entire portfolios, or difficult to configure.

Privacy was another major concern. I didn't want to share wallet addresses or transaction details with third-party services. BTC Tracker solves this by running locally and keeping all data on your machine.

The result is a focused tool that tracks Bitcoin investments while respecting privacy - no unnecessary features, no data sharing.

## Features

- **Investment Tracking**: Record and manage your Bitcoin transactions
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Track investments in EUR, USD, PLN, GBP, JPY, CHF
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculate P&L and ROI for your portfolio
- **Historical Data**: View Bitcoin price trends over time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **CSV Import/Export**: Easy data migration
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Choose your preferred visual style
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication with password protection and session management
- **CoinGecko API Integration**: Optional API key support for higher rate limits
- **Containerized**: Runs in Docker or Podman with minimal setup

  
## Quick Start (Easiest Method) üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wilqq-the/BTC-tracker.git
   cd BTC-tracker
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   chmod +x run-app.sh
   ./run-app.sh
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

That's it! The script automatically:
- Detects if you have Docker or Podman installed
- Pulls the latest image from Docker Hub
- Runs the application
- Persists your data between runs

## Using Docker Hub Image Directly

You can also run BTC Tracker directly from Docker Hub without cloning the repository:

```bash
# Create a directory for your data
mkdir -p btc-tracker-data

# Run the container
docker run -d --name btc-tracker -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)/btc-tracker-data:/app/src/data" docker.io/thewilqq/btc-tracker:latest

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

To update to the latest version:

```bash
docker pull docker.io/thewilqq/btc-tracker:latest
docker stop btc-tracker
docker rm btc-tracker
docker run -d --name btc-tracker -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd)/btc-tracker-data:/app/src/data" docker.io/thewilqq/btc-tracker:latest
```

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Standard Installation

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wilqq-the/BTC-tracker.git
   cd BTC-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Manual Docker/Podman Installation

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions on running with Docker or Podman manually.

## Usage

### First-Time Setup

When you first run the application, you'll be prompted to create an administrator account. This account will be used to access the application and manage your data.

### Authentication

- **Login**: Access the application using your username and password
- **Remember Me**: Option to stay logged in for 30 days
- **Password Change**: Change your password through the Admin Panel
- **Session Management**: Sessions automatically expire after 24 hours (or 30 days with Remember Me)
- **Security**: Passwords are securely hashed and stored using bcrypt

### Adding Transactions

1. Navigate to the Admin Panel
2. Upload a CSV file with your transaction data or use the template
3. Your transactions will appear in the Transactions page

### Viewing Portfolio Performance

The Dashboard provides an overview of:
- Current BTC holdings
- Total investment cost
- Current portfolio value
- Profit & Loss (P&L)
- Historical performance chart

### Managing Settings

1. Navigate to the Admin Panel
2. Select your preferred currency settings
3. (Optional) Add your CoinGecko API key for better rate limits and reliability
   - Get a free API key at [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing)
   - This allows up to 10,000 calls per month instead of the default 10-30 calls per minute

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in JSON files within the `/src/data` directory and persists between application restarts.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express for the backend
- Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Passport.js for authentication
- Bcrypt for secure password hashing
- Express Session for session management
- External APIs:
  - CoinGecko API for BTC prices
  - ExchangeRate API for currency conversion

### CoinGecko API Integration

The application uses CoinGecko's API to fetch Bitcoin price data. By default, it uses the free tier which has rate limitations.

#### Adding Your CoinGecko API Key

1. Navigate to the Admin Panel
2. In the settings section, enter your CoinGecko API key
3. Click "Test Key" to verify it works correctly
4. Save your settings

#### How to Get a CoinGecko API Key

1. Visit [CoinGecko API Pricing](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing)
2. Sign up for the "Demo" plan (free, no credit card required)
3. Copy your API key that starts with "CG-"

#### API Key Usage Notes

- Demo API keys (starting with "CG-") are passed as URL query parameters (`x_cg_demo_api_key`)
- This increases your rate limit from approximately 10-30 calls/minute to 10,000 calls/month
- The app will automatically handle correctly formatting API requests with your key
- If no API key is provided, the application uses the standard free tier endpoint
